          <h1>The journey to reinvent breakfast</h1>
          <p>
            We’re Hywel and Hugh, friends united by a passion for health,
            nutrition and sport. Over the past 3 years, we’ve been on a mission
            to reinvent breakfast, creating a functional high protein range
            designed to fuel active and busy lifestyles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we’re proud to offer three powerful options: overnight oats,
            cereal, and granola. Each crafted to deliver the perfect balance of
            protein, energy and nutrition.
          </p>

            Hi, we’re Hywel and Hugh 👋. Our journey started with a simple goal:
            to reinvent breakfast for modern, active lifestyles. We believe that
            food should be both delicious and functional.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over 3 years, we experimented, tested, and refined our recipes until
            we created the perfect balance of protein, taste, and nutrition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, our products—overnight oats, cereal, and granola—are trusted
            by thousands to fuel busy mornings and active days.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for being part of our journey ❤️</p>
